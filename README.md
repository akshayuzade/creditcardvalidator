# A Simple Credit Card Validator Tool

A validating credit card is an important point while receiving payment through an HTML form. In this code, I have discussed how to validate a credit card number (in a different format) using JavaScript. There are various companies in financial market offer credit cards. But there is no common format in the credit card numbering system, it varies company to company. 

I am not sure that all the formats which I have discussed here are correct because time to time a company can change their numbering format. You can easily change a format with simply modify the regular expression which we have used for various cards. Here are some format of some well-known credit cards.

American Express :- Starting with 34 or 37, length 15 digits.

Visa :- Starting with 4, length 13 or 16 digits.

MasterCard :- Starting with 51 through 55, length 16 digits.

Discover :- Starting with 6011, length 16 digits or starting with 5, length 15 digits.

Diners Club :- Starting with 300 through 305, 36, or 38, length 14 digits.

JCB :- Starting with 2131 or 1800, length 15 digits or starting with 35, length 16 digits.
